# InputfieldSplashAndGrab

This module attaches a search input to selected image fields that lets you search and download images from Unsplash.
(Unsplash is a stock photo service where you can download images for free and use as you wish. No strings attached.)   
You can search by string, colors, orientation/crop and order by relevance or time published

I find Unsplash useful both for placeholder images when building sites but also as a time saver for editors if they donâ€™t have any images at hand, just search, download and publish.

Thanks to Apesia for building the  FlickrInputField Module and Robin for AddImageUrls,  took a lot ideas and code from those modules.
